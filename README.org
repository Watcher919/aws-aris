#+TITLE: Amazon Web Services for Haskell

* Introduction

The 'aws' package attempts to provide support for using Amazon Web Services like S3 (storage), SQS (queuing) and others
to Haskell programmers. The ultimate goal is to support all Amazon Web Services.

* Installation

Make sure you have a recent GHC installed, as well as cabal-install, and installation should be as easy as:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cabal install aws
#+END_SRC

If you prefer to install from source yourself, you should first get a clone of the 'aws' repository, and install it from
inside the source directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aristidb/aws.git
$ cd aws
$ cabal install
#+END_SRC
